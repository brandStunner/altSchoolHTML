        <p>
            This is Rutherford Kofi Brandful, I just prefer the Kofi Brandful. In fact, if I am
            naming myself today, I will be just Kofi Brandful. Enough of that lol.
            I am a geological engineer. Look I love that to bits. I have done amazing projects and 
            I look at them and smile.

            <h3>Current Goals</h3>
            <p>Now though, I just wants to work at the comfort of my
                home and not loose my ability to continue building stuff.

        <h4>What I look forward to</h4>
        <p>
            I have big plans for this, and I believe AltSchool will help me with it.
            I am the visual type of guy and thus, I believe Frontend development is my go to
            for now. It's been a cool experience for the time being. Looking forward to more <br>
            amazing stuff, joining a tech company that provides solutions in the ordinary person 
            and make life easier for everyone
